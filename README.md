**Project Overview**
This repository contains a comprehensive equity research report on LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE. Developed by a team of five students, this project simulates a professional buy-side analysis.

**Scope of the Analysis**
The report provides a detailed examination of the following areas:

* **Strategic Framework:** Analysis of the luxury industry structure, barriers to entry, and competitive rivalry using Porter's 5 Forces.
* **Macroeconomic Assessment:** Evaluation of key drivers such as currency fluctuations (JPY/EUR), inflationary pressures, and demand dynamics in key regions like China and the US.
* **Peer Group Benchmarking:** A refined comparative analysis focusing on the "Big 3" luxury conglomerates (LVMH, Kering, Richemont) rather than broad sector averages.
* **Financial Valuation:** Implementation of valuation methodologies including EV/EBITDA and Price-to-Free Cash Flow (P/FCF) to determine implied share price targets.
* **ESG Profile:** Review of the Group's environmental sustainability, social responsibility, and governance scores.

**Repository Contents**

* **LVMH_Report.pdf:** The full equity research document containing the investment thesis, data analysis, and final recommendation.
* **LVMH_ratios.xlsx** The supporting financial dataset containing the quantitative models. This file includes the raw data for the "Big 3" peer comparison, the calculation of key financial ratios (Profitability, Liquidity, Return metrics), and the computation of the valuation multiples used to derive the target price range.
